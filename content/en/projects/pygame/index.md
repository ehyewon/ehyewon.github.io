This project was developed using the **Pygame library in Python** to create a simple mini-game.  
The player can move left and right with the arrow keys, jump, and shoot enemies using the spacebar.

To add humor, my professor at the time, **Professor Hong Deukjo**, was featured as the final boss.  

(However, I intentionally made the game difficult â€” itâ€™s *impossible* to defeat the boss.  
If you somehow manage to meet or beat the boss, please contact me. Iâ€™ll grant any wish you want ðŸ˜†)

I was responsible for the **life indicator, character movement, and all in-game images and drawings**.

- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Main Library:** Pygame
